## What will we cover today?
- 9.30am-1pm: an introduction to scalable and reproducible analysis using pandas
- 2pm-5.30pm: an introduction to scalable data visualisation with ggplot / plotnine

```{r setup, include=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Morning plan

- Short lecture (this one)
- Interactive "code along" session
- Interspersed with "bonus" questions and breaks!

## Afternoon plan

- 2pm-2.30/40pm: lecture on grammar of graphics (in ggplot/plotnine)
- Then onwards: problem sets

## What today is not about

How to write code that executes quickly

## What is today about?

Scalable and reproducible data analysis

## What is scalable data analysis?

- Scalability is *not* about code speed
- It is about *useful analysis* speed: how long does the process of analysis take to arrive at a useful result?

## What is scalable data analysis?

- The process of data analysis is messy and inevitably full of errors and wrong turns
- Speed of error discovery and correction is key
- Agility of analysis framework also key
- Software for scalable data analysis allows low marginal effort for increasingly complex analyses

## What is reproducible data analysis?

- Analyses that are reliable
- Analyses that are reproducible
- Analyses that are so expressive of intent that they are almost immediately understandable by others

# An aside on code smells

# Empathy and writing

- Steven Pinker argues that empathy is key to good academic writing
- Even if writing solo, you can reduce the empathy gap with readers
- You can ask a future you if they understand what you mean
- (Better) you can ask others if they understand

# Empathy and coding

- For others to be able to reproduce or replicate what you've done, they have to understand it
- Writing understandable code also makes it less likely to be buggy
- Empathy with future users is hence key to writing good code

# Empathy and coding

Reduce the empathy gap by:

- Refactoring relentlessly as future you re-encounters code
- Code collaboratively
- Being aware of good and bad coding practices

# Good and bad code

There are many ways to write good software.

There are fewer ways to write bad software.

*Code smells* are recognised patterns of code likely to hinder understanding and make it hard to work with.

Code smells are actually named (Fowler, 2000).

# Which is not a real code smell?

- Long Parameter List
- Duplicated Code
- Global Data
- Large Class
- Feature Envy
- Inappropriate Intimacy
- Angry Lovers
- Freeloader

# Why learn how to smell?

Code smells have well-defined remedies.

Learning to classify code as whiffing of a particular odour means you can apply these.

# What is this function about ?

```r
model <- function(start, stop, stoc, spec, dens,
                  b, i_mat, i_dur, ntype, ncov)
{
  # function's body
}
```

# Change names to convey meaning

```r
simulate <- function(time_start, time_stop, is_stochastic,
                     mosquito_species, mosquito_density,
                     mosquito_to_human_prob, immunity_maternal,
                     immunity_duration, net_type, net_coverage)
{
  # function's body
}
```

# Tip # 1

"Have you met my good friend 'bSty_1800'?"

Use descriptive variable names

# Long method smell

A long method is simply one with many lines of code. "Generally, any method longer than ten lines should make you start asking questions", **Refactoring Guru**.

Why do they occur?


- It's easier to write code than it is to read it
- When new functionality is required, it can feel easier to add to existing methods rather than create new ones

# What problems do they cause?

The longer a function is

- The harder it is to understand it
- The harder it is to maintain
- The harder it is to test
- The more likely it will contain duplicate code

# Where to find out more

- Martin Fowler, Kent Beck *Refactoring, 2nd edition* (Esp chapter 3)
- "Better Codehub" badges on Github: semi-automated checking of software

# Software for scalable and reproducible analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "200px",include=T,fig.align="center"} 
  knitr::include_graphics("figures/tidyverse.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "300px",include=T,fig.align="center"} 
  knitr::include_graphics("figures/pandas.png")
```

# Both use dataframes

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
df <- read.csv("data/master.csv") %>% 
  mutate(age=fct_relevel(age,
                         "5-14 years",
                         "15-24 years",
                         "25-34 years",
                         "35-54 years",
                         "55-74 years",
                         "75+ years"))
df_sum <- df %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(suicides.100k.pop=mean(suicides.100k.pop)) %>% 
  arrange(suicides.100k.pop) %>% 
  filter(suicides.100k.pop > 0)
df_sum <- df_sum[c(10:10, 40:41, 98:99), ]
countries <- df_sum$country
df <- df %>% 
  filter(country %in% countries) %>% 
  select(country, year, age, sex, suicides_no, population)

kable(df[1:100, ],format="html",escape = F, col.names = colnames(df)) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

# Task

Keep only female rows and select only the country, year, sex and suicide count columns

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# subset
df_temp <- df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'female') %>% 
  select(country, year, sex, suicides_no)
# print
kable(df_temp[1:100, ],format="html",escape = F) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>%
  kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

# Tidyverse

```r
df %>% 
  filter(sex == 'female') %>% 
  select(country, year, sex, suicides_no)
```

# Pandas

```python
df_1 = df[df['sex' == 'female']]
df_1[['year', 'country', 'sex', 'suicides_no']]
```
