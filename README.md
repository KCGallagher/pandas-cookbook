Pandas cookbook
===============

This is an adapted version of the [pandas cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook).

It uses 3 datasets:

* 311 calls in New York
* How many people were on Montr√©al's bike paths in 2012
* Montreal's weather for 2012, hourly

The lecture / problem set is going to be follow along, where we all code together.
