Pandas cookbook
===============

This is an adapted version of the [pandas cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook).

It uses 3 datasets:

* 311 calls in New York
* How many people were on Montr√©al's bike paths in 2012
* Montreal's weather for 2012, hourly

The lecture / problem set is going to be follow along, where we all code together.

Course content
=================


* [Chapter 1: Reading from a CSV](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%201%20-%20Reading%20from%20a%20CSV.ipynb)
  <br> Reading your data into pandas is pretty much the easiest thing. Even when the encoding is wrong!
* [Chapter 2: Selecting data & finding the most common complaint type](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%202%20-%20Selecting%20data%20&%20finding%20the%20most%20common%20complaint%20type.ipynb)
  <br>It's not totally obvious how to select data from a pandas dataframe. Here I explain the basics (how to take slices and get columns)
* [Chapter 3: Which borough has the most noise complaints? (or, more selecting data)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%203%20-%20Which%20borough%20has%20the%20most%20noise%20complaints%20%28or%2C%20more%20selecting%20data%29.ipynb)
  <br>Here we get into serious slicing and dicing and learn how to filter dataframes in complicated ways, really fast.
* [Chapter 4: Find out on which weekday people bike the most with groupby and aggregate](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%204%20-%20Find%20out%20on%20which%20weekday%20people%20bike%20the%20most%20with%20groupby%20and%20aggregate.ipynb)
  <br> The groupby/aggregate is seriously my favorite thing about pandas and I use it all the time. You should probably read this.
* [Chapter 5: String operations! Which month was the snowiest?](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%206%20-%20String%20Operations-%20Which%20month%20was%20the%20snowiest.ipynb)
  <br> Strings with pandas are great. It has all these vectorized string operations and they're the best. We will turn a bunch of strings containing "Snow" into vectors of numbers in a trice.
